## Usage

### PART A

+ Please execute this script in the directory: '..\PartA\'
+ Please ensure to include the util package 'Wrappers' , 'Data' and 'Photos' folder
+ In Task1, 2, 4, you can directly run my code and immediately see the output of CMD logs and plotted figures. 
+ In Task3, you need to enter your interested SNR values. If you only care about the SNR = 0 situations, you can enter any non-numeric values (like blank, enter…)

### PART B

+ Please execute this script in the directory: '..\PartB\'
+ Please ensure to include the util package 'Wrappers' and 'Data' folder
+ In Task1, 2, 3, 4, you can directly run my code and immediately see the output of CMD logs and plotted figures.
