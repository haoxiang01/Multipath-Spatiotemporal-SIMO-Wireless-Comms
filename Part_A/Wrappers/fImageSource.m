% Reads an image file with AxB pixels and produces a column vector of bits
% of length Q=AxBx3x8 where 3 represents the R, G and B matrices used to
% represent the image and 8 represents an 8 bit integer. If P>Q then
% the vector is padded at the bottom with zeros.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Inputs
% filename (String) = The file name of the image
% P (Integer) = Number of bits to produce at the output - Should be greater
% than or equal to Q=AxBx3x8
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Outputs
% bitsOut (Px1 Integers) = P bits (1's and 0's) representing the image
% x (Integer) = Number of pixels in image in x dimension
% y (Integer) = Number of pixels in image in y dimension
