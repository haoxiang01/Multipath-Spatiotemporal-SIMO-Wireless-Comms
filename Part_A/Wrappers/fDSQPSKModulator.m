% Perform DS-QPSK Modulation on a vector of bits using a gold sequence
% with channel symbols set by a phase phi
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Inputs
% bitsIn (Px1 Integers) = P bits of 1's and 0's to be modulated
% goldseq (Wx1 Integers) = W bits of 1's and 0's representing the gold
% sequence to be used in the modulation process
% phi (Integer) = Angle index in degrees of the QPSK constellation points
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Outputs
% symbolsOut (Rx1 Complex) = R channel symbol chips after DS-QPSK Modulation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
