% Takes polynomial weights and produces an M-Sequence
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Inputs
% coeffs (Px1 Integers) = Polynomial coefficients. For example, if the
% polynomial is D^5+D^3+D^1+1 then the coeffs vector will be [1;0;1;0;1;1]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Outputs
% MSeq (Wx1 Integers) = W bits of 1's and 0's
