% Performs channel estimation for the desired source using the received signal
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Inputs
% symbolsIn (Fx1 Complex) = R channel symbol chips received
% goldseq (Wx1 Integers) = W bits of 1's and 0's representing the gold
% sequence of the desired source used in the modulation process
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Outputs
% delay_estimate = Vector of estimates of the delays of each path of the
% desired signal
% DOA_estimate = Estimates of the azimuth and elevation of each path of the
% desired signal
% beta_estimate = Estimates of the fading coefficients of each path of the
% desired signal
